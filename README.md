## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/microgrid-management

# Install dependencies
cd microgrid-management
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

```

## Energy Trading System

### Trading Mechanism
```javascript
// Example energy trade
const energyTrading = await EnergyTrading.deployed();
await energyTrading.createOrder(
    energyAmount,
    price,
    duration,
    type, // buy/sell
    { from: prosumer }
);
```

### Price Discovery Formula
```solidity
energyPrice = baseRate * (demandFactor + gridStressFactor) * timeOfDayMultiplier
where:
- baseRate: Base energy price
- demandFactor: Current demand level
- gridStressFactor: Grid stability metric
- timeOfDayMultiplier: Peak/off-peak adjustment
```

## Load Balancing

### Device Communication
```javascript
// IoT data integration example
class SmartMeterAdapter {
    async collectData(deviceId) {
        const meter = await IoTRegistry.getDevice(deviceId);
        return await meter.getConsumptionData();
    }
}
```
